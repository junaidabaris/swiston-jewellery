                  Once every week, clean your diamond jewellery in lukewarm soap
                  water and rub it down gently with a brush, to remove the dirt
                  and grime from the surface and ensure a long lasting shine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove your diamond jewellery when you go swimming or while
                  doing household chores, so that the grime doesnâ€™t make your
                  jewellery look dull.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep your jewellery in separate boxes to reduce the chances of
                  scratches on the metal.
                </li>
